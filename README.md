Efficient hardware implementations of cryptographic algorithms have been of
much interest recent years where speed and performance are a crucial factor.
All the famous cryptographic algorithms use modular operations
(Montgomery) to avoid direct multiplication and division of very large
numbers. In this paper we investigate the performance improvement of
Montgomery modular operations by replacing normal multipliers with Vedic
multipliers in FPGA. (Refer complete report here: ["Project Report"](PrasannaBalaji_SebinShajiPhilip-Revised_First_draft-20191213.pdf))
